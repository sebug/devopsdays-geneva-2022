## Developer Productivity Engineering - Etienne Studer

Two thirds of GDP digitalized, so given our current way of organizing things
that's quite scary!

Flaky tests - embarrassing re-run the tests.

Working in groups increases pain threshold - which is a bad thing here, because you're not focusing on reducing the pain.

Not to be confused with Developer Productivity Management which is less
scientific.

Issues:

- Takes too long
- Takes too long to fix
- This could have been prevented

These inefficiencies add up.
